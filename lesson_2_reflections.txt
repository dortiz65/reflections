Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My Android class projects.



What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Init creates meta-folder .git which will hold commit info.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Files in working directory may or may not be put in version control. 
Files in staging area get committed to repository. 
You can have files that are not necessary to the final project in working directory.
