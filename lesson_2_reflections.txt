Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My Android class projects.



What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Init creates meta-folder .git which will hold commit info.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Files in working directory may or may not be put in version control. 
Files in staging area get committed to repository. 
You can have files that are not necessary to the final project in working directory. 



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Use git status to see files ready to be committed from working directory. 


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Introduce a branch to try experimental code leaving known good code in master. 
If experimental code breaks, just go back to master. 





How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Branches show workflow development of the code. 


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches leaves a single head node where there used to be two.
