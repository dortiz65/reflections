How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Able to see typo introduced in new version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Can reuse base version of code in future project. 
Saves time of re-writing code. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: Can commit when it makes sense and maintain runnable code in version control.
Cons: May not save frequently enough. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git was designed for code where a change to a routine in one file may require
changes in files calling the routine in other files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to view description of changes commited. 
Use git diff to see lines of code changed--added lines in green; deleted lines in red.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It is easy to go back to a previous version and find what caused an error. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My Android class projects.
